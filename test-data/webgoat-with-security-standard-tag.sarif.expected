The third example shows how the obtained Intent can be sanitized by removing dangerous flags before using it to return data to the calling component.\n\n\n```java\npublic class IntentUriPermissionManipulation extends Activity {\n\n    // BAD: the user-provided Intent is returned as-is\n    public void dangerous() {\n        Intent intent = getIntent();\n        intent.putExtra(\"result\", \"resultData\");\n        setResult(intent);\n    }\n\n    // GOOD: a new Intent is created and returned\n    public void safe() {\n        Intent intent = new Intent();\n        intent.putExtra(\"result\", \"resultData\");\n        setResult(intent);\n    }\n\n    // GOOD: the user-provided Intent is sanitized before being returned\n    public void sanitized() {\n        Intent intent = getIntent();\n        intent.putExtra(\"result\", \"resultData\");\n        intent.removeFlags(\n                Intent.FLAG_GRANT_WRITE_URI_PERMISSION | Intent.FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION);\n        setResult(intent);\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\n## References\n* Google Help: [Remediation for Intent Redirection Vulnerability](https://support.google.com/faqs/answer/9267555?hl=en).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-266](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/266.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-926](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/926.html).\n"},"properties":{"tags":["security","external/cwe/cwe-266","external/cwe/cwe-926","owasp-top10-2021","A04:2021 - Insecure Design"],"description":"Returning an externally provided Intent via 'setResult' may allow a malicious\n              application to access arbitrary content providers of the vulnerable application.","id":"java/android/intent-uri-permission-manipulation","kind":"path-problem","name":"Intent URI permission manipulation","precision":"high","problem.severity":"error","security-severity":"7.8"}},{"id":"java/android/debuggable-attribute-enabled","name":"java/android/debuggable-attribute-enabled","shortDescription":{"text":"Android debuggable attribute enabled"},"fullDescription":{"text":"An enabled debugger can allow for entry points in the application or reveal sensitive information."},"defaultConfiguration":{"enabled":true,"level":"warning"},"help":{"text":"# Android debuggable attribute enabled\nThe Android manifest file defines configuration settings for Android applications.

A malicious application could provide the name of an arbitrary fragment, even one not designed to be externally accessible, and inject it into the activity. This can bypass access controls and expose the application to unintended effects.\n\nFragments are reusable parts of an Android application's user interface. Even though a fragment controls its own lifecycle and layout, and handles its input events, it cannot exist on its own: it must be hosted either by an activity or another fragment. This means that, normally, a fragment will be accessible by third-party applications (that is, exported) only if its hosting activity is itself exported.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nIn general, do not instantiate classes (including fragments) with user-provided names unless the name has been properly validated.

If the user includes a format specifier in the cardSecurityCode field, they may be able to cause an exception to be thrown, or to be able to access extra information about the stored card expiration date.\n\nThe second format call shows the correct approach. The user-provided value is passed as an argument to the format call. This prevents any format specifiers in the user provided value from being evaluated.\n\n\n## References\n* SEI CERT Oracle Coding Standard for Java: [IDS06-J.

This type of attack uses external entity references to access arbitrary files on a system, carry out denial of service, or server side request forgery. Even when the result of parsing is not returned to the user, out-of-band data retrieval techniques may allow attackers to steal sensitive data. Denial of services can also be carried out in this situation.\n\nThere are many XML parsers for Java, and most of them are vulnerable to XXE because their default settings enable parsing of external entities. This query currently identifies vulnerable XML parsing from the following parsers: `javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilder`, `javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamReader`, `org.jdom.input.SAXBuilder`/`org.jdom2.input.SAXBuilder`, `javax.xml.parsers.SAXParser`,`org.dom4j.io.SAXReader`, `org.xml.sax.XMLReader`, `javax.xml.transform.sax.SAXSource`, `javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory`, `javax.xml.transform.sax.SAXTransformerFactory`, `javax.xml.validation.SchemaFactory`, `javax.xml.bind.Unmarshaller` and `javax.xml.xpath.XPathExpression`.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nThe best way to prevent XXE attacks is to disable the parsing of any Document Type Declarations (DTDs) in untrusted data. If this is not possible you should disable the parsing of external general entities and external parameter entities. This improves security but the code will still be at risk of denial of service and server side request forgery attacks. Protection against denial of service attacks may also be implemented by setting entity expansion limits, which is done by default in recent JDK and JRE implementations. Because there are many different ways to disable external entity retrieval with varying support between different providers, in this query we choose to specifically check for the [OWASP recommended way](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/XML_External_Entity_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#java) to disable external entity retrieval for a particular parser. There may be other ways of making a particular parser safe which deviate from these guidelines, in which case this query will continue to flag the parser as potentially dangerous.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example calls `parse` on a `DocumentBuilder` that is not safely configured on untrusted data, and is therefore inherently unsafe.\n\n\n```java\npublic void parse(Socket sock) throws Exception {\n  DocumentBuilderFactory factory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();\n  DocumentBuilder builder = factory.newDocumentBuilder();\n  builder.parse(sock.getInputStream()); //unsafe\n}\n\n```\nIn this example, the `DocumentBuilder` is created with DTD disabled, securing it against XXE attack.\n\n\n```java\npublic void disableDTDParse(Socket sock) throws Exception {\n  DocumentBuilderFactory factory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();\n  factory.setFeature(\"http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl\", true);\n  DocumentBuilder builder = factory.newDocumentBuilder();\n  builder.parse(sock.getInputStream()); //safe\n}\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP vulnerability description: [XML External Entity (XXE) Processing](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XML_External_Entity_(XXE)_Processing).\n* OWASP guidance on parsing xml files: [XXE Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/XML_External_Entity_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#java).\n* Paper by Timothy Morgen: [XML Schema, DTD, and Entity Attacks](https://research.nccgroup.com/2014/05/19/xml-schema-dtd-and-entity-attacks-a-compendium-of-known-techniques/)\n* Out-of-band data retrieval: Timur Yunusov &amp; Alexey Osipov, Black hat EU 2013: [XML Out-Of-Band Data Retrieval](https://www.slideshare.net/qqlan/bh-ready-v4).\n* Denial of service attack (Billion laughs): [Billion Laughs.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs)\n* The Java Tutorials: [Processing Limit Definitions.](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jaxp/limits/limits.html)\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-611](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-776](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/776.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-827](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/827.html).\n","markdown":"# Resolving XML external entity in user-controlled data\nParsing untrusted XML files with a weakly configured XML parser may lead to an XML External Entity (XXE) attack.

Read [this guide](https://cowtowncoder.medium.com/jackson-2-10-safe-default-typing-2d018f0ce2ba).\n\n\n**Kryo** - `com.esotericsoftware:kryo` and `com.esotericsoftware:kryo5`\n\n* **Secure by Default**: Yes for `com.esotericsoftware:kryo5` and for `com.esotericsoftware:kryo` &gt;= v5.0.0\n* **Recommendation**: Don't call `com.esotericsoftware.kryo(5).Kryo#setRegistrationRequired` with the argument `false` on any `Kryo` instance that may deserialize untrusted data.\n\n\n**ObjectInputStream** - `Java Standard Library`\n\n* **Secure by Default**: No\n* **Recommendation**: Use a validating input stream, such as `org.apache.commons.io.serialization.ValidatingObjectInputStream`.\n\n\n**SnakeYAML** - `org.yaml:snakeyaml`\n\n* **Secure by Default**: No\n* **Recommendation**: Pass an instance of `org.yaml.snakeyaml.constructor.SafeConstructor` to `org.yaml.snakeyaml.Yaml`'s constructor before using it to deserialize untrusted data.\n\n\n**XML Decoder** - `Standard Java Library`\n\n* **Secure by Default**: No\n* **Recommendation**: Do not use with untrusted user input.\n\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example calls `readObject` directly on an `ObjectInputStream` that is constructed from untrusted data, and is therefore inherently unsafe.\n\n\n```java\npublic MyObject {\n  public int field;\n  MyObject(int field) {\n    this.field = field;\n  }\n}\n\npublic MyObject deserialize(Socket sock) {\n  try(ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(sock.getInputStream())) {\n    return (MyObject)in.readObject(); // unsafe\n  }\n}\n\n```\nRewriting the communication protocol to only rely on reading primitive types from the input stream removes the vulnerability.\n\n\n```java\npublic MyObject deserialize(Socket sock) {\n  try(DataInputStream in = new DataInputStream(sock.getInputStream())) {\n    return new MyObject(in.readInt());\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP vulnerability description: [Deserialization of untrusted data](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Deserialization_of_untrusted_data).\n* OWASP guidance on deserializing objects: [Deserialization Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Deserialization_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* Talks by Chris Frohoff &amp; Gabriel Lawrence: [ AppSecCali 2015: Marshalling Pickles - how deserializing objects will ruin your day](http://frohoff.github.io/appseccali-marshalling-pickles/), [OWASP SD: Deserialize My Shorts: Or How I Learned to Start Worrying and Hate Java Object Deserialization](http://frohoff.github.io/owaspsd-deserialize-my-shorts/).\n* Alvaro Muñoz &amp; Christian Schneider, RSAConference 2016: [Serial Killer: Silently Pwning Your Java Endpoints](https://speakerdeck.com/pwntester/serial-killer-silently-pwning-your-java-endpoints).\n* SnakeYaml documentation on deserialization: [SnakeYaml deserialization](https://bitbucket.org/snakeyaml/snakeyaml/wiki/Documentation#markdown-header-loading-yaml).\n* Hessian deserialization and related gadget chains: [Hessian deserialization](https://paper.seebug.org/1137/).\n* Castor and Hessian java deserialization vulnerabilities: [Castor and Hessian deserialization](https://securitylab.github.com/research/hessian-java-deserialization-castor-vulnerabilities/).\n* Remote code execution in JYaml library: [JYaml deserialization](https://www.cybersecurity-help.cz/vdb/SB2020022512).\n* JsonIO deserialization vulnerabilities: [JsonIO deserialization](https://klezvirus.github.io/Advanced-Web-Hacking/Serialisation/).\n* Research by Moritz Bechler: [Java Unmarshaller Security - Turning your data into code execution](https://www.github.com/mbechler/marshalsec/blob/master/marshalsec.pdf?raw=true)\n* Blog posts by the developer of Jackson libraries: [On Jackson CVEs: Don’t Panic — Here is what you need to know](https://cowtowncoder.medium.com/on-jackson-cves-dont-panic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-54cd0d6e8062) [Jackson 2.10: Safe Default Typing](https://cowtowncoder.medium.com/jackson-2-10-safe-default-typing-2d018f0ce2ba)\n* Jabsorb documentation on deserialization: [Jabsorb JSON Serializer](https://github.com/Servoy/jabsorb/blob/master/src/org/jabsorb/).\n* Jodd JSON documentation on deserialization: [JoddJson Parser](https://json.jodd.org/parser).\n* RCE in Flexjson: [Flexjson deserialization](https://codewhitesec.blogspot.com/2020/03/liferay-portal-json-vulns.html).\n* Android Intent deserialization vulnerabilities with GSON parser: [Insecure use of JSON parsers](https://blog.oversecured.com/Exploiting-memory-corruption-vulnerabilities-on-Android/#insecure-use-of-json-parsers).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html).\n","markdown":"# Deserialization of user-controlled data\nDeserializing untrusted data using any deserialization framework that allows the construction of arbitrary serializable objects is easily exploitable and in many cases allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

This query currently supports Kryo, XmlDecoder, XStream, SnakeYaml, JYaml, JsonIO, YAMLBeans, HessianBurlap, Castor, Burlap, Jackson, Jabsorb, Jodd JSON, Flexjson, Gson and Java IO serialization through `ObjectInputStream`/`ObjectOutputStream`.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nAvoid deserialization of untrusted data if at all possible. If the architecture permits it then use other formats instead of serialized objects, for example JSON or XML. However, these formats should not be deserialized into complex objects because this provides further opportunities for attack. For example, XML-based deserialization attacks are possible through libraries such as XStream and XmlDecoder.\n\nAlternatively, a tightly controlled whitelist can limit the vulnerability of code, but be aware of the existence of so-called Bypass Gadgets, which can circumvent such protection measures.\n\nRecommendations specific to particular frameworks supported by this query:\n\n**FastJson** - `com.alibaba:fastjson`\n\n* **Secure by Default**: Partially\n* **Recommendation**: Call `com.alibaba.fastjson.parser.ParserConfig#setSafeMode` with the argument `true` before deserializing untrusted data.\n\n\n**FasterXML** - `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind`\n\n* **Secure by Default**: Yes\n* **Recommendation**: Don't call `com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper#enableDefaultTyping` and don't annotate any object fields with `com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonTypeInfo` passing either the `CLASS` or `MINIMAL_CLASS` values to the annotation. Read [this guide](https://cowtowncoder.medium.com/jackson-2-10-safe-default-typing-2d018f0ce2ba).\n\n\n**Kryo** - `com.esotericsoftware:kryo` and `com.esotericsoftware:kryo5`\n\n* **Secure by Default**: Yes for `com.esotericsoftware:kryo5` and for `com.esotericsoftware:kryo` &gt;= v5.0.0\n* **Recommendation**: Don't call `com.esotericsoftware.kryo(5).Kryo#setRegistrationRequired` with the argument `false` on any `Kryo` instance that may deserialize untrusted data.\n\n\n**ObjectInputStream** - `Java Standard Library`\n\n* **Secure by Default**: No\n* **Recommendation**: Use a validating input stream, such as `org.apache.commons.io.serialization.ValidatingObjectInputStream`.\n\n\n**SnakeYAML** - `org.yaml:snakeyaml`\n\n* **Secure by Default**: No\n* **Recommendation**: Pass an instance of `org.yaml.snakeyaml.constructor.SafeConstructor` to `org.yaml.snakeyaml.Yaml`'s constructor before using it to deserialize untrusted data.\n\n\n**XML Decoder** - `Standard Java Library`\n\n* **Secure by Default**: No\n* **Recommendation**: Do not use with untrusted user input.\n\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example calls `readObject` directly on an `ObjectInputStream` that is constructed from untrusted data, and is therefore inherently unsafe.\n\n\n```java\npublic MyObject {\n  public int field;\n  MyObject(int field) {\n    this.field = field;\n  }\n}\n\npublic MyObject deserialize(Socket sock) {\n  try(ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(sock.getInputStream())) {\n    return (MyObject)in.readObject(); // unsafe\n  }\n}\n\n```\nRewriting the communication protocol to only rely on reading primitive types from the input stream removes the vulnerability.\n\n\n```java\npublic MyObject deserialize(Socket sock) {\n  try(DataInputStream in = new DataInputStream(sock.getInputStream())) {\n    return new MyObject(in.readInt());\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP vulnerability description: [Deserialization of untrusted data](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Deserialization_of_untrusted_data).\n* OWASP guidance on deserializing objects: [Deserialization Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Deserialization_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* Talks by Chris Frohoff &amp;

Alternatively, an alternate regex library that guarantees linear time execution, such as Google's RE2J, may be used.\n\n\n## Example\nConsider this use of a regular expression, which removes all leading and trailing whitespace in a string:\n\n```java\n\n\t\t\tPattern.compile(\"^\\\\s+|\\\\s+$\").matcher(text).replaceAll(\"\") // BAD\n\t\t\n```\nThe sub-expression `\"\\\\s+$\"` will match the whitespace characters in `text` from left to right, but it can start matching anywhere within a whitespace sequence. This is problematic for strings that do **not** end with a whitespace character. Such a string will force the regular expression engine to process each whitespace sequence once per whitespace character in the sequence.\n\nThis ultimately means that the time cost of trimming a string is quadratic in the length of the string. So a string like `\"a b\"` will take milliseconds to process, but a similar string with a million spaces instead of just one will take several minutes.\n\nAvoid this problem by rewriting the regular expression to not contain the ambiguity about when to start matching whitespace sequences. For instance, by using a negative look-behind (`\"^\\\\s+|(?<!\\\\s)\\\\s+$\"`), or just by using the built-in trim method (`text.trim()`).\n\nNote that the sub-expression `\"^\\\\s+\"` is **not** problematic as the `^` anchor restricts when that sub-expression can start matching, and as the regular expression engine matches from left to right.\n\n\n## Example\nAs a similar, but slightly subtler problem, consider the regular expression that matches lines with numbers, possibly written using scientific notation:\n\n```java\n\n\t\t\t\"^0\\\\.\\\\d+E?\\\\d+$\"\" \n\t\t\n```\nThe problem with this regular expression is in the sub-expression `\\d+E?\\d+` because the second `\\d+` can start matching digits anywhere after the first match of the first `\\d+` if there is no `E` in the input string.\n\nThis is problematic for strings that do **not** end with a digit. Such a string will force the regular expression engine to process each digit sequence once per digit in the sequence, again leading to a quadratic time complexity.\n\nTo make the processing faster, the regular expression should be rewritten such that the two `\\d+` sub-expressions do not have overlapping matches: `\"^0\\\\.\\\\d+(E\\\\d+)?$\"`.\n\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [Regular expression Denial of Service - ReDoS](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS).\n* Wikipedia: [ReDoS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReDoS).\n* Wikipedia: [Time complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity).\n* James Kirrage, Asiri Rathnayake, Hayo Thielecke: [Static Analysis for Regular Expression Denial-of-Service Attack](http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~hxt/research/reg-exp-sec.pdf).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-1333](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-730](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/730.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-400](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html).\n","markdown":"# Polynomial regular expression used on uncontrolled data\nSome regular expressions take a long time to match certain input strings to the point where the time it takes to match a string of length *n* is proportional to *n<sup>k</sup>* or even *2<sup>n</sup>*.

Alternatively, an alternate regex library that guarantees linear time execution, such as Google's RE2J, may be used.\n\n\n## Example\nConsider this use of a regular expression, which removes all leading and trailing whitespace in a string:\n\n```java\n\n\t\t\tPattern.compile(\"^\\\\s+|\\\\s+$\").matcher(text).replaceAll(\"\") // BAD\n\t\t\n```\nThe sub-expression `\"\\\\s+$\"` will match the whitespace characters in `text` from left to right, but it can start matching anywhere within a whitespace sequence. This is problematic for strings that do **not** end with a whitespace character. Such a string will force the regular expression engine to process each whitespace sequence once per whitespace character in the sequence.\n\nThis ultimately means that the time cost of trimming a string is quadratic in the length of the string. So a string like `\"a b\"` will take milliseconds to process, but a similar string with a million spaces instead of just one will take several minutes.\n\nAvoid this problem by rewriting the regular expression to not contain the ambiguity about when to start matching whitespace sequences. For instance, by using a negative look-behind (`\"^\\\\s+|(?<!\\\\s)\\\\s+$\"`), or just by using the built-in trim method (`text.trim()`).\n\nNote that the sub-expression `\"^\\\\s+\"` is **not** problematic as the `^` anchor restricts when that sub-expression can start matching, and as the regular expression engine matches from left to right.\n\n\n## Example\nAs a similar, but slightly subtler problem, consider the regular expression that matches lines with numbers, possibly written using scientific notation:\n\n```java\n\n\t\t\t\"^0\\\\.\\\\d+E?\\\\d+$\"\" \n\t\t\n```\nThe problem with this regular expression is in the sub-expression `\\d+E?\\d+` because the second `\\d+` can start matching digits anywhere after the first match of the first `\\d+` if there is no `E` in the input string.\n\nThis is problematic for strings that do **not** end with a digit. Such a string will force the regular expression engine to process each digit sequence once per digit in the sequence, again leading to a quadratic time complexity.\n\nTo make the processing faster, the regular expression should be rewritten such that the two `\\d+` sub-expressions do not have overlapping matches: `\"^0\\\\.\\\\d+(E\\\\d+)?$\"`.\n\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [Regular expression Denial of Service - ReDoS](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS).\n* Wikipedia: [ReDoS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReDoS).\n* Wikipedia: [Time complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity).\n* James Kirrage, Asiri Rathnayake, Hayo Thielecke: [Static Analysis for Regular Expression Denial-of-Service Attack](http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~hxt/research/reg-exp-sec.pdf).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-1333](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-730](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/730.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-400](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html).\n"},"properties":{"tags":["security","external/cwe/cwe-1333","external/cwe/cwe-730","external/cwe/cwe-400"],"description":"A regular expression that can require polynomial time\n              to match may be vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks.","id":"java/polynomial-redos","kind":"path-problem","name":"Polynomial regular expression used on uncontrolled data","precision":"high","problem.severity":"warning","security-severity":"7.5"}},{"id":"java/maven/non-https-url","name":"java/maven/non-https-url","shortDescription":{"text":"Failure to use HTTPS or SFTP URL in Maven artifact upload/download"},"fullDescription":{"text":"Non-HTTPS connections can be intercepted by third parties."},"defaultConfiguration":{"enabled":true,"level":"error"},"help":{"text":"# Failure to use HTTPS or SFTP URL in Maven artifact upload/download\nUsing an insecure protocol like HTTP or FTP to download your dependencies leaves your Maven build vulnerable to a [Man in the Middle (MITM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack).

This applies to various database query languages, including SQL and the Java Persistence Query Language.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nUsually, it is better to use a SQL prepared statement than to build a complete SQL query with string concatenation. A prepared statement can include a wildcard, written as a question mark (?), for each part of the SQL query that is expected to be filled in by a different value each time it is run. When the query is later executed, a value must be supplied for each wildcard in the query.\n\nIn the Java Persistence Query Language, it is better to use queries with parameters than to build a complete query with string concatenation. A Java Persistence query can include a parameter placeholder for each part of the query that is expected to be filled in by a different value when run. A parameter placeholder may be indicated by a colon (:) followed by a parameter name, or by a question mark (?) followed by an integer position. When the query is later executed, a value must be supplied for each parameter in the query, using the `setParameter` method. Specifying the query using the `@NamedQuery` annotation introduces an additional level of safety: the query must be a constant string literal, preventing construction by string concatenation, and the only way to fill in values for parts of the query is by setting positional parameters.\n\nIt is good practice to use prepared statements (in SQL) or query parameters (in the Java Persistence Query Language) for supplying parameter values to a query, whether or not any of the parameters are directly traceable to user input. Doing so avoids any need to worry about quoting and escaping.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the following example, the code runs a simple SQL query in two different ways.\n\nThe first way involves building a query, `query1`, by concatenating an environment variable with some string literals. The environment variable can include special characters, so this code allows for SQL injection attacks.\n\nThe second way, which shows good practice, involves building a query, `query2`, with a single string literal that includes a wildcard (`?`). The wildcard is then given a value by calling `setString`. This version is immune to injection attacks, because any special characters in the environment variable are not given any special treatment.\n\n\n```java\n{\n    // BAD: the category might have SQL special characters in it\n    String category = System.getenv(\"ITEM_CATEGORY\");\n    Statement statement = connection.createStatement();\n    String query1 = \"SELECT ITEM,PRICE FROM PRODUCT WHERE ITEM_CATEGORY='\"\n        + category + \"' ORDER BY PRICE\";\n    ResultSet results = statement.executeQuery(query1);\n}\n\n{\n    // GOOD: use a prepared query\n    String category = System.getenv(\"ITEM_CATEGORY\");\n    String query2 = \"SELECT ITEM,PRICE FROM PRODUCT WHERE ITEM_CATEGORY=? ORDER BY PRICE\";\n    PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement(query2);\n    statement.setString(1, category);\n    ResultSet results = statement.executeQuery();\n}\n```\n\n## Example\nThe following code shows several different ways to run a Java Persistence query.\n\nThe first example involves building a query, `query1`, by concatenating an environment variable with some string literals. Just like the SQL example, the environment variable can include special characters, so this code allows for Java Persistence query injection attacks.\n\nThe remaining examples demonstrate different methods for safely building a Java Persistence query with user-supplied values:\n\n1. `query2` uses a single string literal that includes a placeholder for a parameter, indicated by a colon (`:`) and parameter name (`category`).\n1. `query3` uses a single string literal that includes a placeholder for a parameter, indicated by a question mark (`?`) and position number (`1`).\n1. `namedQuery1` is defined using the `@NamedQuery` annotation, whose `query` attribute is a string literal that includes a placeholder for a parameter, indicated by a colon (`:`) and parameter name (`category`).\n1. `namedQuery2` is defined using the `@NamedQuery` annotation, whose `query` attribute includes a placeholder for a parameter, indicated by a question mark (`?`) and position number (`1`).\nThe parameter is then given a value by calling `setParameter`. These versions are immune to injection attacks, because any special characters in the environment variable or user-supplied value are not given any special treatment.\n\n\n```java\n{\n    // BAD: the category might have Java Persistence Query Language special characters in it\n    String category = System.getenv(\"ITEM_CATEGORY\");\n    Statement statement = connection.createStatement();\n    String query1 = \"SELECT p FROM Product p WHERE p.category LIKE '\"\n        + category + \"' ORDER BY p.price\";\n    Query q = entityManager.createQuery(query1);\n}\n\n{\n    // GOOD: use a named parameter and set its value\n    String category = System.getenv(\"ITEM_CATEGORY\");\n    String query2 = \"SELECT p FROM Product p WHERE p.category LIKE :category ORDER BY p.price\"\n    Query q = entityManager.createQuery(query2);\n    q.setParameter(\"category\", category);\n}\n\n{\n    // GOOD: use a positional parameter and set its value\n    String category = System.getenv(\"ITEM_CATEGORY\");\n    String query3 = \"SELECT p FROM Product p WHERE p.category LIKE ?1 ORDER BY p.price\"\n    Query q = entityManager.createQuery(query3);\n    q.setParameter(1, category);\n}\n\n{\n    // GOOD: use a named query with a named parameter and set its value\n    @NamedQuery(\n            name=\"lookupByCategory\",\n            query=\"SELECT p FROM Product p WHERE p.category LIKE :category ORDER BY p.price\")\n    private static class NQ {}\n    ...\n    String category = System.getenv(\"ITEM_CATEGORY\");\n    Query namedQuery1 = entityManager.createNamedQuery(\"lookupByCategory\");\n    namedQuery1.setParameter(\"category\", category);\n}\n\n{\n    // GOOD: use a named query with a positional parameter and set its value\n    @NamedQuery(\n            name=\"lookupByCategory\",\n            query=\"SELECT p FROM Product p WHERE p.category LIKE ?1 ORDER BY p.price\")\n    private static class NQ {}\n    ...\n    String category = System.getenv(\"ITEM_CATEGORY\");\n    Query namedQuery2 = entityManager.createNamedQuery(\"lookupByCategory\");\n    namedQuery2.setParameter(1, category);\n}\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [SQL Injection Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* SEI CERT Oracle Coding Standard for Java: [IDS00-J.

Doing so avoids any need to worry about quoting and escaping.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the following example, the code runs a simple SQL query in two different ways.\n\nThe first way involves building a query, `query1`, by concatenating an environment variable with some string literals. The environment variable can include special characters, so this code allows for SQL injection attacks.\n\nThe second way, which shows good practice, involves building a query, `query2`, with a single string literal that includes a wildcard (`?`). The wildcard is then given a value by calling `setString`. This version is immune to injection attacks, because any special characters in the environment variable are not given any special treatment.\n\n\n```java\n{\n    // BAD: the category might have SQL special characters in it\n    String category = System.getenv(\"ITEM_CATEGORY\");\n    Statement statement = connection.createStatement();\n    String query1 = \"SELECT ITEM,PRICE FROM PRODUCT WHERE ITEM_CATEGORY='\"\n        + category + \"' ORDER BY PRICE\";\n    ResultSet results = statement.executeQuery(query1);\n}\n\n{\n    // GOOD: use a prepared query\n    String category = System.getenv(\"ITEM_CATEGORY\");\n    String query2 = \"SELECT ITEM,PRICE FROM PRODUCT WHERE ITEM_CATEGORY=? ORDER BY PRICE\";\n    PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement(query2);\n    statement.setString(1, category);\n    ResultSet results = statement.executeQuery();\n}\n```\n\n## Example\nThe following code shows several different ways to run a Java Persistence query.\n\nThe first example involves building a query, `query1`, by concatenating an environment variable with some string literals. Just like the SQL example, the environment variable can include special characters, so this code allows for Java Persistence query injection attacks.\n\nThe remaining examples demonstrate different methods for safely building a Java Persistence query with user-supplied values:\n\n1. `query2` uses a single string literal that includes a placeholder for a parameter, indicated by a colon (`:`) and parameter name (`category`).\n1. `query3` uses a single string literal that includes a placeholder for a parameter, indicated by a question mark (`?`) and position number (`1`).\n1. `namedQuery1` is defined using the `@NamedQuery` annotation, whose `query` attribute is a string literal that includes a placeholder for a parameter, indicated by a colon (`:`) and parameter name (`category`).\n1. `namedQuery2` is defined using the `@NamedQuery` annotation, whose `query` attribute includes a placeholder for a parameter, indicated by a question mark (`?`) and position number (`1`).\nThe parameter is then given a value by calling `setParameter`. These versions are immune to injection attacks, because any special characters in the environment variable or user-supplied value are not given any special treatment.\n\n\n```java\n{\n    // BAD: the category might have Java Persistence Query Language special characters in it\n    String category = System.getenv(\"ITEM_CATEGORY\");\n    Statement statement = connection.createStatement();\n    String query1 = \"SELECT p FROM Product p WHERE p.category LIKE '\"\n        + category + \"' ORDER BY p.price\";\n    Query q = entityManager.createQuery(query1);\n}\n\n{\n    // GOOD: use a named parameter and set its value\n    String category = System.getenv(\"ITEM_CATEGORY\");\n    String query2 = \"SELECT p FROM Product p WHERE p.category LIKE :category ORDER BY p.price\"\n    Query q = entityManager.createQuery(query2);\n    q.setParameter(\"category\", category);\n}\n\n{\n    // GOOD: use a positional parameter and set its value\n    String category = System.getenv(\"ITEM_CATEGORY\");\n    String query3 = \"SELECT p FROM Product p WHERE p.category LIKE ?1 ORDER BY p.price\"\n    Query q = entityManager.createQuery(query3);\n    q.setParameter(1, category);\n}\n\n{\n    // GOOD: use a named query with a named parameter and set its value\n    @NamedQuery(\n            name=\"lookupByCategory\",\n            query=\"SELECT p FROM Product p WHERE p.category LIKE :category ORDER BY p.price\")\n    private static class NQ {}\n    ...\n    String category = System.getenv(\"ITEM_CATEGORY\");\n    Query namedQuery1 = entityManager.createNamedQuery(\"lookupByCategory\");\n    namedQuery1.setParameter(\"category\", category);\n}\n\n{\n    // GOOD: use a named query with a positional parameter and set its value\n    @NamedQuery(\n            name=\"lookupByCategory\",\n            query=\"SELECT p FROM Product p WHERE p.category LIKE ?1 ORDER BY p.price\")\n    private static class NQ {}\n    ...\n    String category = System.getenv(\"ITEM_CATEGORY\");\n    Query namedQuery2 = entityManager.createNamedQuery(\"lookupByCategory\");\n    namedQuery2.setParameter(1, category);\n}\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [SQL Injection Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n* SEI CERT Oracle Coding Standard for Java: [IDS00-J.

If a SpEL expression is built using attacker-controlled data, and then evaluated in a powerful context, then it may allow the attacker to run arbitrary code.\n\nThe `SpelExpressionParser` class parses a SpEL expression string and returns an `Expression` instance that can be then evaluated by calling one of its methods. By default, an expression is evaluated in a powerful `StandardEvaluationContext` that allows the expression to access other methods available in the JVM.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nIn general, including user input in a SpEL expression should be avoided. If user input must be included in the expression, it should be then evaluated in a limited context that doesn't allow arbitrary method invocation.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example uses untrusted data to build a SpEL expression and then runs it in the default powerful context.\n\n\n```java\npublic Object evaluate(Socket socket) throws IOException {\n  try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(\n      new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()))) {\n\n    String string = reader.readLine();\n    ExpressionParser parser = new SpelExpressionParser();\n    Expression expression = parser.parseExpression(string);\n    return expression.getValue();\n  }\n}\n```\nThe next example shows how an untrusted SpEL expression can be run in `SimpleEvaluationContext` that doesn't allow accessing arbitrary methods.

It uses a custom implementation of `JexlUberspect` that checks if callees are instances of allowed classes.\n\n\n```java\npublic void evaluate(Socket socket) throws IOException {\n  try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(\n        new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()))) {\n    \n    JexlUberspect sandbox = new JexlUberspectSandbox();\n    JexlEngine jexl = new JexlBuilder().uberspect(sandbox).create();\n      \n    String input = reader.readLine();\n    JexlExpression expression = jexl.createExpression(input);\n    JexlContext context = new MapContext();\n    expression.evaluate(context);\n  }\n\n  private static class JexlUberspectSandbox implements JexlUberspect {\n\n    private static final List<String> ALLOWED_CLASSES =\n              Arrays.asList(\"java.lang.Math\", \"java.util.Random\");\n\n    private final JexlUberspect uberspect = new JexlBuilder().create().getUberspect();\n\n    private void checkAccess(Object obj) {\n      if (!ALLOWED_CLASSES.contains(obj.getClass().getCanonicalName())) {\n        throw new AccessControlException(\"Not allowed\");\n      }\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public JexlMethod getMethod(Object obj, String method, Object... args) {\n      checkAccess(obj);\n      return uberspect.getMethod(obj, method, args);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public List<PropertyResolver> getResolvers(JexlOperator op, Object obj) {\n      checkAccess(obj);\n      return uberspect.getResolvers(op, obj);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void setClassLoader(ClassLoader loader) {\n      uberspect.setClassLoader(loader);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public int getVersion() {\n      return uberspect.getVersion();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public JexlMethod getConstructor(Object obj, Object... args) {\n      checkAccess(obj);\n      return uberspect.getConstructor(obj, args);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public JexlPropertyGet getPropertyGet(Object obj, Object identifier) {\n      checkAccess(obj);\n      return uberspect.getPropertyGet(obj, identifier);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public JexlPropertyGet getPropertyGet(List<PropertyResolver> resolvers, Object obj, Object identifier) {\n      checkAccess(obj);\n      return uberspect.getPropertyGet(resolvers, obj, identifier);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public JexlPropertySet getPropertySet(Object obj, Object identifier, Object arg) {\n      checkAccess(obj);\n      return uberspect.getPropertySet(obj, identifier, arg);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public JexlPropertySet getPropertySet(List<PropertyResolver> resolvers, Object obj, Object identifier, Object arg) {\n      checkAccess(obj);\n      return uberspect.getPropertySet(resolvers, obj, identifier, arg);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public Iterator<?> getIterator(Object obj) {\n      checkAccess(obj);\n      return uberspect.getIterator(obj);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public JexlArithmetic.Uberspect getArithmetic(JexlArithmetic arithmetic) {\n      return uberspect.getArithmetic(arithmetic);\n    } \n  }\n}\n```\n\n## References\n* Apache Commons JEXL: [Project page](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-jexl/).\n* Apache Commons JEXL documentation: [JEXL 2.1.1 API](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-jexl/javadocs/apidocs-2.1.1/).\n* Apache Commons JEXL documentation: [JEXL 3.1 API](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-jexl/apidocs/index.html).\n* OWASP: [Expression Language Injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Expression_Language_Injection).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-94](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html).\n"},"properties":{"tags":["security","external/cwe/cwe-094"],"description":"Evaluation of a user-controlled JEXL expression\n              may lead to arbitrary code execution.","id":"java/jexl-expression-injection","kind":"path-problem","name":"Expression language injection (JEXL)","precision":"high","problem.severity":"error","security-severity":"9.3"}},{"id":"java/server-side-template-injection","name":"java/server-side-template-injection","shortDescription":{"text":"Server-side template injection"},"fullDescription":{"text":"Untrusted input interpreted as a template can lead to remote code execution."},"defaultConfiguration":{"enabled":true,"level":"error"},"help":{"text":"# Server-side template injection\nTemplate injection occurs when user input is embedded in a template's code in an unsafe manner.

If the JavaScript contains vulnerabilities or the WebView loads untrusted content, file access allows an attacker to steal the user's data.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nWhen possible, do not allow file access. The file access settings are disabled by default.

The index should be smaller than the array size, and it should not be negative.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following program accesses an element from a fixed size constant array:\n\n\n```java\npublic class ImproperValidationOfArrayIndex extends HttpServlet {\n\n  protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)\n  throws ServletException, IOException {\n    String[] productDescriptions = new String[] { \"Chocolate bar\", \"Fizzy drink\" };\n\n    // User provided value\n    String productID = request.getParameter(\"productID\");\n    try {\n        int productID = Integer.parseInt(userProperty.trim());\n\n        /*\n         * BAD Array is accessed without checking if the user provided value is out of\n         * bounds.\n         */\n        String productDescription = productDescriptions[productID];\n\n        if (productID >= 0 && productID < productDescriptions.length) {\n          // GOOD We have checked that the array index is valid first\n          productDescription = productDescriptions[productID];\n        } else {\n          productDescription = \"No product for that ID\";\n        }\n\n        response.getWriter().write(productDescription);\n\n    } catch (NumberFormatException e) { }\n  }\n}\n```\nThe first access of the `productDescriptions` array uses the user-provided value as the index without performing any checks. If the user provides a negative value, or a value larger than the size of the array, then an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` may be thrown.\n\nThe second access of the `productDescriptions` array is contained within a conditional expression that verifies the user-provided value is a valid index into the array. This ensures that the access operation never throws an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.\n\n\n## References\n* Java API Specification: [ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-129](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/129.html).\n"},"properties":{"tags":["security","external/cwe/cwe-129"],"description":"Using external input as an index to an array, without proper validation, can lead to index out of bound exceptions.","id":"java/improper-validation-of-array-index","kind":"path-problem","name":"Improper validation of user-provided array index","precision":"medium","problem.severity":"warning","security-severity":"8.8"}},{"id":"java/improper-validation-of-array-construction","name":"java/improper-validation-of-array-construction","shortDescription":{"text":"Improper validation of user-provided size used for array construction"},"fullDescription":{"text":"Using unvalidated external input as the argument to a construction of an array can lead to index out of bound exceptions."},"defaultConfiguration":{"enabled":true,"level":"warning"},"help":{"text":"# Improper validation of user-provided size used for array construction\nUsing unvalidated input when specifying the size of a newly created array can result in the creation of an array with size zero.

The result of `getCategory` can include special characters, or it might be refactored later so that it may return something that contains special characters.\n\nThe second way, which shows good practice, involves building a query, `query2`, with a single string literal that includes a wildcard (`?`).
